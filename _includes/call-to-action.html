            I’m a rising senior at Sacramento State who’s passionate about
            dedicating time and interest in developing and designing clean and
            detailed code. I have a strong vision to create simple UI and make
            sure it’s usability is at its best. I’m also an avid learner,
            teaching myself to work with software tools such as Adobe
            Illustrator/Photoshop to explore and expand my creative side. My
            current interests are Web Development, UX/UI, Product Development
            and Graphic Design.

            Outside of coding, you will probably catch me drinking green tea,
            practicing mindfulness or reading The Joy of Living by Yongey
            Mingyur Rinpoche.

            I’m actively seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2021.
